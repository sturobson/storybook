# Storybook for HTML <sup>alpha</sup>

* * *

Storybook for HTML is a UI development environment for your plain HTML snippets.
With it, you can visualize different states of your UI components and develop them interactively.

Storybook runs outside of your app.
So you can develop UI components in isolation without worrying about app specific dependencies and requirements.

## Getting Started
(**note:** To get the alpha version of Storybook for HTML to run correctly you will need to install an alpha version of `cli` (included in the commands below).)

```sh
npm i -g @storybook/cli@v4.0.0-alpha.10
cd my-app
getstorybook --html
```

Storybook also comes with a lot of [addons](https://storybook.js.org/addons/introduction) and a great API to customize as you wish.
You can also build a [static version](https://storybook.js.org/basics/exporting-storybook) of your storybook and deploy it anywhere you want.
